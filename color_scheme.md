# Dashboard Template Color Scheme

This dashboard template blends soft neutrals with warm gradients and a dark accent to create a calm yet energetic feel. Key colors include:

- **Background Base:** A warm light beige (`#F4F0E9`) used across the canvas, producing a soft, inviting backdrop.
- **Panel Surfaces:** Slightly darker beige-grey (`#E8E2D9`) panels with rounded corners that float above the base through subtle drop shadows.
- **Primary Accent Gradient:** A radial blend ranging from golden yellow (`#F5C350`) through peach (`#F8A864`) to warm coral (`#F07A59`), used on the workout heat map and circular metrics to communicate energy and progression.
- **Secondary Accent:** Rich amber-orange (`#F3A43B`) applied to progress highlights and buttons to reinforce the warm energy theme.
- **Alert Accent:** Vibrant crimson (`#D74D3F`) marking calorie burn peaks and active schedule days for quick recognition of high activity.
- **Supportive Neutral:** Cool medium gray (`#C4C2BD`) for icon outlines, separators, and muted text, balancing the warmth of the palette.
- **Primary Text:** Deep charcoal (`#2A2C33`) ensuring readability against the light background.
- **Calendar Panel:** Desaturated midnight navy (`#1F2432`) providing contrast for the calendar widget, with active day dots in amber-orange and scheduled-day dots in soft gray.
- **Success Feedback:** Fresh lime-green accent (`#8FCB5B`) in the weight loss progress ring to signal positive progress.
- **Micro-copy Text:** Soft warm gray (`#9F9B95`) for secondary labels and supporting descriptions, maintaining hierarchy without harsh contrast.

Textures and highlights rely on translucent white overlays (~20% opacity) and subtle inner shadows to create depth without abandoning the overall minimal, modern aesthetic.
